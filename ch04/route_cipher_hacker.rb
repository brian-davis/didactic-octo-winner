# Brute-force hack a Union Route Cipher.

# Designed for whole-word transposition ciphers with variable rows & columns.
# Assumes encryption began at either top or bottom of a column.
# Possible keys auto-generated based on number of columns & rows input.
# Key indicates the order to read columns and the direction to traverse.
# Negative column numbers mean start at bottom and read up.
# Positive column numbers means start at top & read down.

# Example below is for 4x4 matrix with key -1 2 -3 4.
# Note "0" is not allowed.
# Arrows show encryption route; for negative key values read UP.

#   1   2   3   4
